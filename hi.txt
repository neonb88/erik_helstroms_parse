10001      Ammonium Sulfate (Fine)         ammSO4f   88339    ug/m^3 LC  If particulate Sulfur (Sf) is non-null, then ammSO4f is calculated as 4.125 * Sulfur.  Otherwise, it is calculated as 1.375 * Sulfate (SO4f).  If the concentration of the base parameter (Sf or SO4f) is below the minimum detection limit, then 0.5 * MDL is used.  (NOTE:  The calculation procedure for RHR datasets differs from this. Please see the RHR guidance documents detailed calculation procedures.)
